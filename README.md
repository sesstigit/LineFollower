# LineFollower
Use Infrared Sensors only to detect and follow a line.  No use of camera.

Note: the Arduino source code is divided into small ino files.  The one to upload to the Arduino is ArduinoLineFollower.ino.
Other ino files required by the main file will be automatically included by the Arduino IDE.
